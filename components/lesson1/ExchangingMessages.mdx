When you opened this page in your web browser, your computer exchanged data with quite a few servers on the internet,
almost unnoticeably to you. In this lesson, we’ll build a network client application, which does something similar to
your browser in this situation.

It all starts with an _address_: you want to send a message to your friend Alice, but your computer needs to know
_where_ these messages should be sent for the message to be delivered to the right computer—just like you need to
provide a recipient address when you send an email.

We are used to one kind of address system: _domain names_, like `lowlvl.org` or `duckduckgo.com`. However, these
addresses are intended to be used by human beings; machines use another addressing system.
Internet protocol (or _IP_) addresses look like `192.168.0.1`. In order to find out which IP address we should use
for a domain name like `lowlvl.org`, we ask a _name server_, a computer with a well-known IP address like
`1.2.3.4`. A name server understands DNS, or the domain name service _protocol_. Protocols are languages in
which computers can talk to each other.

So why don't we give it a try? Let's translate a domain name into an IP address:

<div id="lesson1-dns-form">
  <DnsRequestForm />
</div>

Below you see a code example written in Rust (if you are not familiar with the Rust syntax, you can refer to
[The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and learn by example).

<Playground id="fullDemo" codeWrapperFn={wrapFullDemoCode}>
  <FullDemoVis />
</Playground>

This should give you a taste of what it's like to work with computer networks. Now let's start looking into
what makes this code tick!
